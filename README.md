# [Predicting Quality of Delivery Metrics for Adaptive Video Codec Sessions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9335813)

This paper introduces a novel algorithm, Codec-aware Network Adaptation Agent (CNAA), designed for predicting video quality metrics such as jitter for video services. CNAA is an online lightweight data learning engine that leverages network information to accurately predict quality of delivery (QoD) metrics even in the presence of congestion and adaptive codecs. The research emphasizes the importance of accurate prediction of video quality given the dominance of video traffic and the strain it poses on limited bandwidth constraints. It highlights shortcomings of baseline machine learning techniques in capturing network dynamics and demonstrates the superior performance of CNAA over state-of-the-art algorithms. The efficacy of CNAA is demonstrated across varying network and codec conditions, underscoring the significance of incorporating network dynamics into machine learning approaches for accurate predictions in cloud-hosted services.

Figure 1 illustrates the role of the CNAA agent in the QoD prediction ecosystem. The learning function incorporates network dynamics, namely, congestion and codec behavior in QoD parameter estimation and prediction. The prediction outputs can be fed into an intermediary network device (e.g. a router) or sent
to a network manager to either take remedial or proactive action.

Figure 2 illustrates the laboratory network set-up for a video streaming session between a server and a client machine using physical Cisco hardware routers. In the network, six routers (R1 - R6, all Cisco 2911 Integrated Services Routers (ISR)) are connected between the server and the client. Both the server and client machines are 64-bit Windows 7 operating system computers. The clocks on the server and the client are synchronized using the Network Time Protocol to match observations from both. Network jitter samples are drawn from the client machine every second. The streaming session is set up on the server machine with the VLC server using the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). The Big Buck Bunny mp4 animation video, approximately 10 minutes long, is used for experiments. Transcoding of the pre-encoded file to either H.264 or H.265 is activated. At this stage, no further default VLC encoding parameters are altered, leaving the bitrate and frame rate, etc., the same as the source file.

Rows 1 (R1) and R2 display traces showing the adaptive behavior of H.264 and H.265 codecs to network congestion. Maximum, minimum, and mean instantaneous jitter values in R1 are (650ms, 1.17ms, 107ms), and in R2 are (750ms, 3.91ms, 126ms) respectively. The structured nature of these time series is noteworthy.

Figure 4 displays an excerpt from the data presented in Row 1, Figure 3. The network jitter time series data can be observed to exhibit an exponentially decaying pattern. Therefore, we assume the unit exponential decay function. 

The CNAA model enables summarization of jitter time series using the following feature set:
- The peak value of the time series exponentially decaying curves
- The decay, and 
- The period.
  
All three features represent the adaptation of the codec in response to different network conditions. The performance of the CNAA model is compared with some baseline models, namely:

- Linear Regression (LR)
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)
- Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)

| CNAA  | 4.82  | 4.07  |
| EWMA  | 115.84 | 65.50  |
| SMA  | 138.88  | 81.24  |

| ARMA(2,1)  | 119.16 | 89.76  |

Table 1 shows the predictive accuracies of the CNAA model compared with some state-of-the-art machine learning models. The models' performance are evaluated using two metrics: root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Comparison of the Codec-Aware Network Adaptation Agent (CNAA) with baseline models reveals significant improvements. Compared to the best-performing baseline model, EWMA, and CNAA techniques demonstrate approximately 95.8% and 93.8% enhancements in terms of RMSE and MAE respectively. More analyses are described and discussed in the attached conference paper illustrating the superior performance of the CNAA model in predicting the jitter time series data and also for network state monitoring.

## Conclusion

In this project, a Codec-aware Network Adaptation Agent (CNAA) is proposedâ€”an in-network agent that achieves accurate and correct predictions of Quality of Delivery (QoD) metrics, specifically jitter, in the face of congestion and adaptive codecs. The performance gain of cNAA was achieved by leveraging the information in the network. The prediction accuracy of cNAA under varying network and codec conditions is demonstrated. Additionally, improvements in prediction accuracy are realized by incorporating network dynamics, as demonstrated with some baseline models. As an online learning engine, cNAA could be deployed in a network to assist network managers in predicting network performance or for network monitoring purposes. The model estimates could also be passed off to some network device, for instance, a router, to effect a change in routes, etc.
